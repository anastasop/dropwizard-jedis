<h1>Welcome</h1>

This is a demo application for <a href="http://github.com/anastasop/dropwizard-jedis">dropwizard-jedis</a>,
a bundle which integrates <a href="http://dropwizard.codahale.com/">dropwizard</a> and 
<a href="https://github.com/xetorthio/jedis">jedis</a> a popular <a href="http://redis.io">redis</a> client.
<p>
The concept is simple. A set of teams and their members are stored in redis. These are all manipulated using the
following restful urls. Of course redis must be up and running before using them. You can check this using the
dropwizard <a href="http://localhost:8081">admin console</a>
<pre>
GET   /teams/
GET   /teams/{name}
POST  /teams/{name}
</pre>
These urls work with both html and json. For example to add a team and its initial members use
<pre>
curl -H"Content-Type: text/plain" -d"Balotelli,Kaka" http://localhost:8080/teams/Milan
</pre>
You can access the database using the following link.
<a href="/teams">Teams</a>
<p>
Enjoy!!
